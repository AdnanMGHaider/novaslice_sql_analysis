# NovaSlice Pizza SQL Analysis Project

## 1. Project Overview

NovaSlice Pizza is a fictional pizza chain operating across major Indian cities.  
This project delivers a complete SQL based analysis of one full cycle of transactional order data.  
The goal is to recreate the type of analytics work performed inside a real food delivery or quick service restaurant environment.

The project covers the complete workflow  
from data loading and schema creation  
to business question framing, stakeholder oriented queries,  
and a full breakdown of revenue, product mix, customer behaviour,  
and operational trends.

This analysis demonstrates core skills expected from an entry level data analyst  
including relational modelling, window functions, aggregation techniques,  
time based analysis, customer segmentation, and structured project presentation.
